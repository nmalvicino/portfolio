      'Hi! I’m Natalia. I’m 30, originally from Argentina and now living in Spain. I started working at 18 as a receptionist and in 2016 I began taking on small graphic design projects. In 2020 I dove deeper with online courses and learned about web design and UX/UI design, something I became very passionate about. I worked as a freelance web designer until 2023, when I made the jump into development. I love bringing my client’s ideas to life and building websites that improve their business. I’m always learning new tools and finding better ways to create to stay in sync with an industry that never sits still.',

      'I spend a lot of time at the pottery studio, it’s a recent discovery but I fell in love with it right away. I also love writing, playing the guitar, singing (ideally when no one’s around) and picking up hobbies that don’t involve screens. That said, I do love gaming: Fallout, Portal and The Legend of Zelda are some of my all-time favorites. I’m pretty sure most of my problem-solving skills come from spending way too many hours on them, and Crash Bandicoot definitely taught me patience (looking at you, Stormy Ascent).',
